## ‚ú® Introduction to Actually Optimized
Actually Optimized is a modpack that aims to improve performance without changing the vanilla experience. 
Experience buttery-smooth gameplay, lightning-fast loading times, and a huge performance boost you wouldn't expect from your potato PC. Check out this [Github Page]() if you want to upgrade your frames even more. 

>**Warning!** This modpack is not done yet. Im still working on making it get the best Performance without having any issues and if you do find any issues or want to suggest something make sure to join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vWu5kTrPqJ) and we will discuss about it there! Also make sure to download the latest release of this Modpack to avoid crashes, errors, etc...

## üì• How do I install Actually Optimized?
- Refer to [Modrinth's documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/modpacks/play) on playing modpacks. The easiest way is a launcher with support for importing Modrinth modpacks. 

- But if you would like to use the Vanilla Launcher, go to my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vWu5kTrPqJ) and download it from there.
After that unzip the file into your [Fabric Instance`s](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) working directory.

## üîß Compatibility 
Actually Optimized does not add any additional features, allowing compatibility with most servers and worlds. This modpack was also meant to be used with other mods, so feel free to add them if you have any! 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Updates Quickly
Actually Optimized gets its updates very quickly! Usually, it takes between 1 hour to 3 days. If a mod is not updated yet, it's most probably because the mod is incompatible with another mod.

Note: This does not apply to snapshots most of the time. I do not bother as they can sometimes require lots of maintenance and come out too quickly.
